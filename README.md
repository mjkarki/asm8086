# asm8086
A small 8086 toy assembler written in Python.

This is a small toy, which I whipped up one night.

With this library you can write simple 8086 programs (DOS .COM programs) that will work either under MS-DOS or DOSBOX. COM binaries are not supported under modern 64-bit Windows environments :(

Check sample.py for a small example.
